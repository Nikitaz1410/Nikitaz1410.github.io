                    <p>
                        At TUM, we noticed a gap: while AI is taking off everywhere, it's not yet being 
                        effectively used to solve the kinds of humanitarian and environmental problems that truly matter. 
                        We have thriving clubs for AI technology, social projects, and startups in Munich, 
                        but no community that brings all three together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's where TUM SociAl comes in. We founded TUM SociAl to fill this void – 
                        combining cutting-edge AI innovation with social and environmental good, 
                        powered by an entrepreneurial spirit. We're here to make sure that AI isn't just used 
                        for corporate profit, but also to help those who need it most.
